# backend-template

Backend application template 

## Getting Started

### Modify `package.json`
The first thing you should do after initializing a new backend project with this repository is to modify the `package.json` to meet your project needs. 
Specifically, ensure that: 
- `name` is set to `@voiceflow/YOUR_PKG_NAME`
- All Github URLs referencing `backend-template` should be modified to point to your project's repository URL

### Setting up CircleCI for automated testing
The default CI template is sufficient to get you started with automated tests:
1. Modify the `.circleci/config.yml` file with the proper package name for the `npm-repo` (this should correspond to your `name` in `package.json`).
2. Inspect the `jobs.test` stanza of the CircleCI config to modify database setup and additional steps for tests. Don't forget to commit your changes
3. Click "Set up project" in the [CircleCI Projects view](https://app.circleci.com/projects/project-dashboard/github/voiceflow/).
4. Select "Use existing config" and click "start building". 
At this point, your project should be set up to automatically run tests on pushes. Please speak to [Frank Gu](frank@voiceflow.com) if you wish to set up the component for dev environments and deployment.
